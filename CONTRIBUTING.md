# Welcome!

The Carbon team is committed to maintaining consistent, quality guidelines. We welcome all feedback, designs, or ideas to produce the best possible experience for our users.

If you're interested in contributing, please follow the guidelines below.

If you have any questions, reach out to us at carbon@us.ibm.com.

## Contributing process

### 1. Submit an issue

The easiest way for us to get an understanding of your needs is to open an issue. Follow our [issue template](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues/new?assignees=&labels=status%3A+needs+triage+%F0%9F%95%B5%EF%B8%8F%E2%80%8D%E2%99%80%EF%B8%8F&projects=&template=bug-report-or-feature-request.md&title=%5BTitle%5D%3A+Brief+description) to ensure you are meeting the issue writing requirements. Screenshots are required when submitting a new pattern or component. A member of the Carbon team will respond to your issue with next steps or a follow up. 

**Not sure where to open an issue?**

The [carbon-design-kit repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit) is for Figma bugs and enhancements, as well as general feedback on the Carbon Design Kit and component design.

The [carbon-website repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website) is for Carbon website bugs, enhancements, and general feedback.

**Not sure how to submit an issue?** 

You can read a [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) on GitHub to get familiar with best practices.

### 2. Design review and sync

The easiest way to move forward in the design process is to schedule an in-person or remote call with the Carbon team to review your design work. We will provide you with feedback on your proposal and let you know if any changes are needed before bringing them into Carbon. 

**What does it take for your design to pass Carbon's design review?**

The Carbon team will look for a few major things: 

### Accessible

* Is your design WCAG AA accessible? 
* Does your design pass [color contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) ratio? 
* Have you considered [keyboard tabbing](https://carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/keyboard) and focus states?

### Componentized

Most components we accept into the global library must work universally across products. 

* Have you tested this design for multiple use cases? It needs to be a pattern all teams can utilize and global enough to fit use cases for other teams. 
* Is there a similar component in the library that already exists? 
* What are the advantages of this pattern over alternative patterns?

### Visual style and UX patterns

* Is your design consistent with our default [visual style](https://carbondesignsystem.com/elements/themes/overview/) we have established for the core Carbon library? 
* Do your interaction patterns (hover, focus, motion, animations) match existing Carbon styles? 
* Does your design follow basic UX best practices? 
* Does your design promote clear language, correct grammar, and support globalization?

_Please ensure you have run through these design guidelines before the initial design review meeting. The Carbon team will be looking for the points mentioned above_ 


### 3. Roadmap
We will work with your team to determine when your design will be implemented into Carbon and the logistics behind it. Development resources are greatly appreciated and welcomed. If your pattern is submitted without any code, please keep in mind that it may be delayed from being released into the Carbon component library until we can fit it into our team sprint schedule.
